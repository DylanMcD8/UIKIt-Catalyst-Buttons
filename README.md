# UIKIt Catalyst Buttons
A sample project demonstrating the different types of buttons and styles available in Mac Catalyst when running on the Mac Idiom. 

Part of this code shows how you can use AppKit to modify certain NSButton attributes, such as `controlSize`. This is technically grounds for App Review rejection, but it has been obfuscated with base64 encoding, so it should be okay.

Thank you to **[Seb Vidal](https://github.com/sebjvidal)** for help with this, especially the AppKit aspects!

*Bonus: this project also shows how you can use an AppKit bridge to give your app a translucent background. I do not promise or gurantee that this is the best way to do it, so if you know of a better way, please let me know or create a pull request!*

All code is free for you to use, with or without credit!
